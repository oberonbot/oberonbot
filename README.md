# Hongzhi (Ethan) Zhao 


**`Developer`**

As a Computer Science graduate student at Stevens Institute of Technology, set to graduate in May, my comprehensive knowledge and passion for diverse fields such as web development, computer vision, natural language processing, and data analysis have driven me to undertake numerous projects in these domains. Moreover, my undergraduate studies have also exposed me to fundamental hardware concepts, such as computer composition principles.

During my internship, I had the privilege of gaining invaluable experience in full-stack web development, using cutting-edge technologies such as Vue.js, Element UI, Springboot, and Oracle Database. Presently, I am focused on honing my skills in the MERN stack, an increasingly popular technology stack for developing robust, efficient, and scalable web pages.

As a technology enthusiast with a deep appreciation for music and art, I strongly believe that combining technology with liberal arts and humanities can produce remarkable results. Driven by a relentless commitment to excellence, I am eager to tackle complex problems and create exceptional products that reflect my dedication to elegant coding and design.
